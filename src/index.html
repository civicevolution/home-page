            <h1>Crowd-assisted Proposal Evolution (CAPE)</h1>
            <div class="mission">

                <p>Crowd-assisted Proposal Evolution (CAPE) is an easy-to-use email-based process that lets anyone introduce an idea to a group
                    and develop it into a widely-supported proposal for action.</p>

                <p>Imagine your group has a problem or opportunity, but no plan to deal with it.
                    Our easy-to-use process can help your group develop a widely-supported plan.</p>

                <p>Here's how CAPE works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Together or individually, write up your initial ideas.</li>
                    <li>Include any questions you can think of for others that might help you improve them.</li>
                    <li>Tell us whom you want to send them to.  (Make your group as diverse as possible.)</li>
                    <li>We send your ideas and questions via email and collect the responses into an easy-to-use
                        workspace.
                    </li>
                    <li>You evaluate, sort, and prioritize the responses with tagging and highlighting.</li>
                    <li>Then you combine your group's responses with the original ideas in an updated plan.</li>
                    <li>Add some new questions to help everyone refine the plan.</li>
                    <li>We send your updated plan and questions to the participants.</li>
                    <li>Continue this process until your group reaches consensus.</li>
                </ol>

                <!--Why cemail?-->
                <!--Get started immediately–no setup required-->
                <!--No new tools for your group to learn–participants simply reply to an email-->
                <!--Or they can choose to explore the full power and history of the process online-->
                <!--Your questions provide very clear calls-to-action for your participants–no guessing what to do-->
                <!--Works with any size group-->
                <!--Privacy and transparency are completely customizable-->
                <!--Our flexible format allows your group to develop simple ideas or complex proposals for action-->
                <!--Integrates with the tools your group already uses-->
                <!--Websites-->
                <!--Chat-->
                <!--Voice and video conferencing-->
                <!--Surveys and polls-->
                <!--You can run the process yourself or work with a professional facilitator to provide independence in tricky situations-->

                <p>CAPE is our newest project and the result of everything we learned. We will begin beta testing in January, 2015</p>
                <!--<p>CAPE provides a simple, convenient and transparent way to collect, organize and make sense of user input in an-->
                <!--ongoing group conversation and report it back to the group and the general public</p>-->

                <h3>About CivicEvolution</h3>

                <p>CivicEvolution is produced by Practical Evolution, LLC based in San Francisco, California.</p>

                <h3>Think together to act together</h3>

                <p>We believe that meaningful change comes from the grassroots in the form of community written and
                    supported plans to solve community problems.</p>

                <h3>How we do it</h3>

                <p>We complement traditional face-to-face citizen engagement with the scalability and access of social
                    media and collaborative production. Our goal is to maximize everyone's ability to participate in
                    creative community problem solving by giving them a platform where they can "Think together to act
                    together."</p>

                <p>Anyone can float ideas and aggregate clicks–meaningful change comes from a community written and
                    supported plan to put an idea into action.</p>

                <p>We solve the pain points experienced by both citizens and decision-makers. Citizens can't commit to
                    full-time activism and decision makers often don't have access to quality and cost-effective public
                    input.</p>

                <p>We empower leaders to make an explicit promise to listen to and collaborate with their constituents
                    by creating a safe, engaging, and productive way for decision makers to gather quality community
                    input.</p>

                <p>Our solution outsources democracy back to the citizens in the form of community plan writing. They
                    elicit community feedback, filter it, and synthesize it into an actionable proposal that
                    decision-makers can review and negotiate.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, citizens experience themselves as authentic participants in the creative co-governance of
                    their communities</p>

                    2011 for ‘vitalizing democracy’</p>
                <h4>Citizens Parliament</h4>

                <p>The first ever Australian Citizens' Parliament brought 150 randomly selected Australians together for
                    3 days to answer the question: "How can Australia's political system be strengthened to serve us
                    better?"</p>

                <p>CivicEvolution provided an Online Parliament for 2600 randomly selected Australian citizens. Hundreds
                    of these citizens used CivicEvolution to develop and support proposals that became the starting
                    point for the face-to-face assembly in Canberra. The Citizens' Parliament deliberated, improved and
                    endorsed 11 of the proposals that were developed in the Online Parliament. The final recommendations
                    of the Citizens' parliament were presented to the Prime Minister, Parliament, and the media.</p>
                <h4>Countywide Community Forums in Seattle, WA</h4>

                <p>Countywide Community Forums is designed to make democracy more user-friendly and to bring the public
                    forum to your kitchen table, neighborhood, and workplace. Over 1800 Citizen Councilors are
                    registered and making their opinion count while building stronger connections to their community.
                    CivicEvolution was tasked to give the citizen participants greater say in the development of the
                    forums and help increase citizen participation in the program.</p>
