                <p>Finding and implementing sustainable solutions requires the insight, cooperation, and support of
                    everyone affected.</p>
                <p>CivicEvolution uses web, mobile, and face-to-face activities and applications to help people come
                    together around their shared concerns in meaningful conversations where they can understand their
                    differences and pursue their mutual interests through practical cooperation.</p>

            <h1 class="sectionTitle">Crowd-assisted Proposal Evolution (CAPE)</h1>
            <div class="mission">

                <p>Crowd-assisted Proposal Evolution (CAPE) is an easy-to-use email-based process that lets anyone introduce an idea to a group
                    and develop it into a widely-supported proposal for action.</p>

                <p>Imagine your group has a problem or opportunity, but no plan to deal with it.
                    Our easy-to-use process can help your group develop a widely-supported plan.</p>

                <p>Here's how CAPE works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Together or individually, write up your initial ideas.</li>
                    <li>Include any questions you can think of for others that might help you improve them.</li>
                    <li>Tell us whom you want to send them to.  (Make your group as diverse as possible.)</li>
                    <li>We send your ideas and questions via email and collect the responses into an easy-to-use
                        workspace.
                    </li>
                    <li>You evaluate, sort, and prioritize the responses with tagging and highlighting.</li>
                    <li>Then you combine your group's responses with the original ideas in an updated plan.</li>
                    <li>Add some new questions to help everyone refine the plan.</li>
                    <li>We send your updated plan and questions to the participants.</li>
                    <li>Continue this process until your group reaches consensus.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>CAPE is our newest project and the result of everything we learned. We will begin beta testing in January, 2015</p>
                <!--<p>CAPE provides a simple, convenient and transparent way to collect, organize and make sense of user input in an-->
                <!--ongoing group conversation and report it back to the group and the general public</p>-->

            <p>Some of the many projects we've partnered on in Australia and the United States are
            described below.</p>

            <p>Our goal is to maximize everyone's ability to participate in
                creative community problem solving by giving them a platform where they can "Think together to act
                together."
            </p>

            <p>We empower leaders to make an explicit promise to listen to and collaborate with their constituents
                by creating a safe, engaging, and productive way for decision makers to gather quality community
                input.</p>

            <p>Our solution outsources democracy back to the citizens in the form of community proposal development.
                Participants work in groups to develop their ideas, elicit community feedback, evaluate, sort,
                and prioritize the feedback, and integrate it into an actionable proposal.
                Through this process, they develop better plans and broad community support.
                </p>
            <p>This is the kind of community input decision-makers need.</p>

                    Our first community deliberation project was created to help a community volleyball club
                    develop a new set of governing rules. Not only did this project provide great experience,
                    but it also demonstrated that deliberative democracy can apply to every organization we
                    belong to and every activity in which we engage.
